FixMyHospital
=============

This is a basic app for reporting problems to hospitals, inspired by FixMyStreet.

It's not currently production-ready, though it is demo-able.

Notably, it does not actually report the problems -- though it is collecting the email 
addresses for hospitals, so this would not be hard to add.
